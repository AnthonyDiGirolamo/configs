;;; Commentary:
;;
;; evil-jumper is an add-on for evil-mode which replaces the
;; implementation of the jump list such that it mimics more closely
;; with Vim's behavior. Specifically, it will jump across buffer
;; boundaries and revive dead buffers if necessary. The jump list can
;; also be persisted to a file and restored between sessions.
;;
;; Install:

;; (require 'evil-jumper)
