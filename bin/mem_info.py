# Try to determine how much RAM is currently being used per program.
# Note the per program, not per process. So for example this script
# will report mem used by all httpd process together. In detail it reports:
# sum(all RSS for process instances) + max(shared mem for any process instance)
#
# The shared calculation below will factor out shared text and
# libs etc. within a program, but not between programs. So there
# will always be some overestimation. This will be the same for
# all processes that just use libc for e.g. but more for others
# that use larger shared libs like gnome, kde etc.

# V1.0      06 Jul 2005    Initial release
# V1.1      11 Aug 2006    root permission required for accuracy
# V1.2      08 Nov 2006    Add total to output
#                          Use KiB,MiB,... for units rather than K,M,...
# V1.3      22 Nov 2006    Ignore shared col from /proc/$pid/statm for
#                          2.6 kernels up to and including 2.6.9.
#                          There it represented the total file backed extent
# V1.4      23 Nov 2006    Remove total from output as it's meaningless
#                          (the shared values overlap with other programs).
#                          Display the shared column. This extra info is
#                          useful, especially as it overlaps between programs.
# V1.5      26 Mar 2007    Remove redundant recursion from human()
# V1.6      05 Jun 2007    Also report number of processes with a given name.
#                          Patch from riccardo.murri@gmail.com

# Notes:
#
# All interpreted programs where the interpreter is started
# by the shell or with env, will be merged to the interpreter
# (as that's what's given to exec). For e.g. all python programs
# starting with "#!/usr/bin/env python" will be grouped under python.
# You can change this by changing comm= to args= below but that will
# have the undesirable affect of splitting up programs started with
# differing parameters (for e.g. mingetty tty[1-6]).
#
# For 2.6 kernels up to and including 2.6.13 and later 2.4 redhat kernels
# (rmap vm without smaps) it can not be accurately determined how many pages
# are shared between processes in general or within a program in our case:
# http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/6/250
# A warning is printed if overestimation is possible.
# In addition for 2.6 kernels up to 2.6.9 inclusive, the shared
# value in /proc/$pid/statm is the total file-backed extent of a process.
# We ignore that, introducing more overestimation, again printing a warning.
#
# I don't take account of memory allocated for a program
# by other programs. For e.g. memory used in the X server for
# a program could be determined, but is not.
#
# This script assumes threads are already merged by ps

# TODO:
#
# use ps just to enumerate the pids and names
# so as to remove the race between reading rss and shared values
